-- üõ†Ô∏è GOLD LAYER BUILD SCRIPT
-- ========================================
-- Project: Modern Data Warehouse (Global Electronic Retailers)
-- Layer: Gold (Business-ready Layer)
-- Purpose:
--   - Transform curated Silver Layer data into final dimension and fact views
--   - Standardize naming conventions and formats
--   - Enrich fact data with calculated fields
--   - Prepare data for reporting (SQL-based analytics or BI tools like Tableau)
-- ========================================

-- ========================================
-- üìå DIMENSION: Customers
-- Renames columns and applies standard naming for use in BI tools
-- ========================================
